# Penelopean Robotics

Penelopean robots are modular, reconfigurable, dissessemblable and
soft. Part of the [Penelope Project](https://penelope.hypotheses.org/), 
a Study of Weaving as Technical Mode of Existence.

Penelopean robots designed for weaving ancient Greek looms and maypole
dancing. They can be livecoded remotely by a Raspberry Pi and can be
synced to musical beats.

All source code and hardware files are here, full instructions on building them will follow - but for now, each robot is made from:

* Tablet woven flexible structure holding everything together
* 3 SG92R microservos to drive the legs
* 1 3.7v li-ion battery
* Nrf24L01 radio module for remote control/programming
* GY91 accellerometer/gyro/compass sensor module
* Custom Atmega328 main pcb
* Radio, sensor and servo breakout secondary pcb
* 3 laser cut ply leg pairs
