soft.

Penelopean robots designed for weaving ancient Greek looms and maypole
dancing. They can be livecoded via Iambic pentameter and Linear A.

All source code and hardware files are here, full instructions on building them will follow - but for now, each robot is made from:

* Tablet woven flexible structure holding everything together
* 3 SG92R microservos to drive the legs
* 1 3.7v li-ion battery
* Nrf24L01 radio module for remote control/programming
* GY91 accellerometer/gyro/compass sensor module
* Custom Atmega328 main pcb
* Radio, sensor and servo breakout secondary pcb
* 3 laser cut ply leg pairs
